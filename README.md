# Meteorix

Meteorix is a mobile application for Android that provides information about meteorites using data from the NASA API. The app utilizes XML parsing, Retrofit for REST API communication, Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, Light and Dark Themes, MVVM architectural pattern, Google Maps API for location visualization, Fragments for UI components, Coroutines for asynchronous programming, and a RecyclerView to display a list of meteorites.

## Features

- Meteorite List: Displays a list of meteorites obtained from the NASA API.
- SearchBar: Provides a search functionality to filter the list of meteorites based on user input.
- XML Parsing: Parses XML data received from the API to extract relevant meteorite information.
- Retrofit: Communicates with the NASA API to retrieve meteorite data through REST API calls.
- Dagger Hilt: Uses dependency injection for managing dependencies and promoting modularity.
- Light and Dark Theme: Supports both light and dark themes to suit user preferences.
- MVVM Architecture: Follows the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern for separation of concerns and maintainable code.
- Google Maps API: Displays the location of meteorites on a MapView within a full-screen fragment.
- Fragments: Utilizes fragments for modular UI components and navigation.
- Coroutines: Uses coroutines for asynchronous and non-blocking programming.
- REST API Integration: Retrieves meteorite details from the NASA API and displays them in the full-screen fragment.
